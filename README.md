: Make a square
Make a square with size 4X4 by using 4 or 5 pieces. The pieces can be rotated or flipped and all pieces should 
be used to form a square. Example sets of pieces. 
There may be more than one possible solution for a set of pieces, and not every arrangement will work even 
with a set for which a solution can be found. Examples using the above set of pieces… 
Rotate piece D 90 degree then flip horizontal {R 90 + F H}
Input: 
The first line contains number of pieces. Each piece is then specified by listing a single line with two 
integers, the number of rows and columns in the piece, followed by one or more lines which specify the 
shape of the piece. The shape specification consists of 0 or 1 characters, with the 1 character indicating 
the solid shape of the puzzle (the 0 characters are merely placeholders). For example, piece A above 
would be specified as follows: 
2 3 
111 
101 
Output: 
Your program should report all solution, in the format shown by the examples below. A 4-row by 4-column 
square should be created, with each piece occupying its location in the solution. The solid portions of 
piece #1 should be replaced with `1' characters, of piece #2 with `2' characters. 
Sample output that represents the figure above could be:
1112
1412
3422
3442
For cases which have no possible solution simply report "No solution possible". 
You must provide many sample inputs (many text files) during the discussion time, to test your project on 
many samples. Each text file represents one problem to be solved
